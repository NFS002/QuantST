An expert EA built in R designed for use with social trading platforms such as eToro,
Here i have used a number of indicators, such as THE 14-day Stochastics, particularly useful in identifying overbought
regions, a 3rd derivative based on the MAC-D indicator, awell as bollinger bands and average momentum indicators to build an 
EA that can be used with any of the time series available from Yahoo Finance. I have provided a list of ticker symbols
currently in use. the EA is useful for timing entry points into markets that are either volatile or when a strond trend
can be easily identified. The project is not finished, but I have used R as i am currently in the process of integrating it with
the eToro (Social Trading Platform)
